## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS

### What I learned

- Recap of basic HTML and CSS

- Using responsive units (rem):

  ```css
  .card-content {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.4rem;
  }

  .card-content-heading {
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin-bottom: 1.6rem;
    display: inline-block;
  }
  ```

- Taking care of accessibility via 'alt' property for images

  ```html
  <img
    class="card-img"
    src="images/image-qr-code.png"
    alt="QR code to Frontend Mentor website"
  />
  ```

- Providing a description for the page

  ```html
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="A simple QR code component consisting of the picture of an QR code and a description.
      The QR code points to the Frontend Mentor website. The description contains a short heading and some further
      text to assist the user."
  />
  ```

### Continued development

- Practicing and understanding box-shadow and its parameters further
